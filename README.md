ITCS 2530- Final Project.
For this final project we were tasked to create a C++ program based on a hobbies of ours, the hobby I chose to use was writing.
This program is a writing aid, to help with getting ideas with random prompts, and allows for saving of ideas in it's own file, and if need be clearing your ideas.
This program created with the help of AI, CoPilot, with some of the programs ideas, prompts, and the code.
